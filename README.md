# kvm-cs16-cheat
A CS 1.6 cheat by directly accessing memory in a virtual machine to prevent detection


cs16-trigger-kvm

Fork from https://github.com/rmccrystal/kvm-csgo-cheat
Works On Counter-Strike 1.6:
Protocol version 48 Exe version 1.1.2.7/Stdio (cstrike) Exe build: 19:53:27 Aug 3 2020 (8684)

Tested with Debian 11, KVM and Windows 10 LTSC 2019 Guest with GPU Passthrough.
On newer Windows 10 Version it does not seem to work.

This is a Triggerbot forked from rmccrystal and only for Demonstration use cases.
It is working on the current Steam version of the game.
Sometimes it can happen that the cheat is not injected into the hl.exe so you may have to restart steam then start cs1.6.

The trigger shoots teammates and enemys. Don't use this hack on VAC secured Servers I cannot guarantee what will happen if you do.
